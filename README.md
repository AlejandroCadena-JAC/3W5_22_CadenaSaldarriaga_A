# REM Trip Planner
This project consists of a planner of the rem stations available in December 2022.

The goal is to provide the user with an estimated arrival time and duration of their trip.

The user selects the stations they are coming from and going to along with their departure time.

The button prints out the stations the user will be passing by along with the estimated arrival time for each station.

The station info button provides a fun fact about the station the user selected.
